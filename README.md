# Contribute article

Contributions from the community and from Adobe employees from outside the documentation teams are welcome.

## Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) or the [.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/policies/code-of-conduct). For more information, see the [Contributing](contributing.md) article.

## How to contribute to Adobe content

**If you are not an Adobe employee**, you can submit an external community contribution. Community contributions are imported to internal systems and are edited and merged in the public repo. The public repo is then synced with the latest changes and merged in the private repository.

**If you are an Adobe employee**, you can contribute directly to the private [Adobe GitHub repository](https://git.corp.adobe.com/AdobeDocs/). For details, see the Adobe Experience League Authoring Guide for Adobe employees.

## External contributors

### Minor changes

If you are contributing a minor update:

1. Navigate to the topic that you want to edit.
1. In the _Was this content helpful?_ banner at the bottom of your browser window, click **Detailed feedback options**.
1. Click **Suggest an edit** and submit a pull request (PR) with your changes in the GitHub UI.

   See the general [Adobe Docs contributor guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/introduction) for more information.

Minor corrections or clarifications you submit for documentation and code examples in this repo are covered by the Adobe terms of use.

### Major changes or new topics from the community

If you're part of the Adobe community and want to create a new topic or submit major changes, use the **Issues** tab in the applicable Git repository to submit an issue. The new issue starts a conversation with the documentation team. When a plan is agreed upon, you work with an Adobe writer to publish your revisions.

**NOTE:** If you submit a pull request with significant changes to documentation and code examples, the pull request displays a message asking you to submit an online contribution license agreement (CLA). Completing this online form is required before a team member can review your pull request.

### Tools

Community contributors can use the GitHub UI for basic editing or fork the repo to make major contributions.

See the [Adobe Docs Contributor Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/introduction) for details.

## Internal contributors

If you are a technical writer, program manager, or developer from the Adobe product team and it's your job to contribute to or author technical articles, use the [private repository](https://git.corp.adobe.com/AdobeDocs). 

## Format your topic

All the articles in this repository use GitHub-flavored Markdown. If you are not familiar with Markdown, see:

* [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en)

## Labels

In the public repository, automated labels are assigned to pull requests to help us manage the pull request workflow and to help let you know what's going on with your pull request:

* **Change sent to author**: The author has been notified of the pending pull request.
* **ready-to-merge**: Ready for review by the pull request review team.
