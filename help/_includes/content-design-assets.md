# Content authoring - assets

In the visual content editor, select the _Assets_ icon  ( ![Show Assets](../user/assets/do-not-localize/icon-assets-design.svg) ) that is displayed on the left.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you have a subscription for Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service along with the default Adobe Marketo Engage Design Studio, you choose the [image source](../user/content/assets-overview.md#choose-an-asset-source) at the time of creation for an email, email template, or visual fragment. You can also select the image source before you open the visual designer for editing.

The following example outlines steps to add assets to the template content:

1. To open the assets library, click the _Assets_ icon.

   From the asset selector, you can directly select assets stored in the source library.

1. Add a new asset by dragging and dropping the image asset into a structure component.

   For more information about using assets from your source type, see [Add assets to your content](../user/content/assets-overview.md#add-assets-to-your-content).

1. Replace an existing image asset by selecting it on the canvas and click **[!UICONTROL Select an asset]** in the image source tools.
