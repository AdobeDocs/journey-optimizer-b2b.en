# Content authoring - assets

In the visual content editor, select the _Marketo Engage Assets_ ( ![Marketo Engage Assets icon](../../help/assets/do-not-localize/icon-assets-me.svg) ) icon or the _Experience Manager Assets_ ( ![Marketo Engage Assets icon](../../help/assets/do-not-localize/icon-assets-aem.svg) ) icon in the left navigation bar. From the asset selector, you can directly select assets stored in the source library.

>If you are provisioned with Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Services, you have access to the repositories for both Marketo Engage Design Studio and Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service when your user account has the required permissions. These repositories are separate and not in sync. You can use image assets from either source.

* Add a new asset by dragging and dropping the image asset into a structure component.
