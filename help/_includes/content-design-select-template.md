# Content authoring - select email template

You can choose from:

* **Sample templates**. The Journey Optimizer interface offers 20 out-of-the-box email templates that you can choose from.

* **Saved templates**. These are templates that you either created from scratch using the _[!UICONTROL Templates]_ menu or saved from an email in a journey using the _[!UICONTROL Save as content template]_ option.

Use the _[!UICONTROL Select design template]_ section to start building your content from a template. You can use a sample template or a saved custome email template from your Journey Optimizer B2B Edition instance.

On the _Design your template_ home page, the _Sample templates_ tab is selected by default. To use a custom template, select the **[!UICONTROL Saved templates]** tab.

The list of all email templates created on the current sandbox displays. You can sort them by _[!UICONTROL Name]_, _[!UICONTROL Last modified]_, and _[!UICONTROL Last created]_.

Select the template that you want from the list.

   After selection, this displays a preview of the template. In preview mode, you can navigate between all the templates of one category (sample or saved, depending on your selection) using the right and left arrows.

When the display matches what you want to use, click **[!UICONTROL Use this template]** at the top right of the preview window.

This action copies the content into the visual content designer, where you can edit the content as needed.
