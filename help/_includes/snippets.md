## Content authoring - components - structures step {#structures-step}

1. To start your content design, drag an item from the **[!UICONTROL Structures]** and drop it onto the canvas.

   Add as many items from _[!UICONTROL Structures]_ as you need and edit the settings for each in the pane on the right.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Select the _[!UICONTROL n:n column]_ component to define the number of columns of your choice (between three and 10). You can also define the width of each column by moving the arrows below the column.

   ![Drag a structure onto the canvas and adjust the settings](../assets/content-design-shared/content-design-add-structure.png){width="800" zoomable="yes"}

   Each column size cannot be less than 10% of the total width of the structure component. Only empty columns can be removed.

## Content authoring - components - contents step {#contents-step}

1. Expand the **[!UICONTROL Contents]** section and add as many elements as you need into one or more structure components.

   ![Border styles](../assets/content-design-shared/content-components-styles-border.png){width="250"}

1. For the **[!UICONTROL Border radius]**, set the numerical value according to the curve you want for the corners. 

   A value of 0 (default) produces a squared corner.

## Content components - margin styles {#styles-margin}

On the right panel with the _[!UICONTROL Styles]_ tab selected, expand the **[!UICONTROL Margin]** section and set the options for margin spacing within the structural component. This style replicates the CSS `margin` parameter, which controls to the space outside a component border, separating it from other components. It creates a gap around the component to influence its positioning and the layout of surrounding content.

Set the margin values in pixels according to your design needs. You can set the margin for all sides, the top-botton, the left-right, or each side of the component independently:

* **All sides** - To set one value to apply to all sides, clear the **[!UICONTROL Different margin for each side]** checkbox. Click the up and down arrow icons to increase or decrease the number of pixels.

   ![Set margin for all sides](../assets/content-design-shared/content-components-styles-margin-all-sides.png){width="250"}

* **Top-bottom** - To set the top and bottom margins to the same value, set the _Locked_ icon between the top and bottom settings. Click the up and down arrow icons for either to increase or decrease the number of pixels.

* **Left-right** - To set the left and right margins to the same value, set the _Locked_ icon between the left and right settings. Click the up and down arrow icons for either to increase or decrease the number of pixels.

   ![Lock margins for top-bottom and left-right margin](../assets/content-design-shared/content-components-styles-margin-locked.png){width="250"}

* **Independent** - To set each margin to an independent value, set the _Unlocked_ icon between the top and bottom settings and between the left and right. For each setting, click the up and down arrow icons for either to increase or decrease the number of pixels.

   ![Set independent margins](../assets/content-design-shared/content-components-styles-margin-unlocked.png){width="250"}

## Content components - padding styles {#styles-padding}

On the right panel with the _[!UICONTROL Styles]_ tab selected, expand the **[!UICONTROL Padding]** section and set the options for padding within the structural component. This style replicates the CSS `padding` parameter, which is the space between the content of a component and its border. The padding provides internal spacing that you can use to control the distance between the content and the border of the component.

Set the padding values in pixels according to your design needs. You can set the padding for all sides, the top-botton, the left-right, or each side of the component independently:

* **All sides** - To set one value to apply to all sides, clear the **[!UICONTROL Different padding for each side]** checkbox. Click the up and down arrow icons to increase or decrease the number of pixels.

   ![Set padding for all sides](../assets/content-design-shared/content-components-styles-padding-all-sides.png){width="250"}

* **Top-bottom** - To set the top and bottom padding to the same value, set the _Locked_ icon between the top and bottom settings. Click the up and down arrow icons for either to increase or decrease the number of pixels.

* **Left-right** - To set the left and right padding to the same value, set the _Locked_ icon between the left and right settings. Click the up and down arrow icons for either to increase or decrease the number of pixels.

   ![Lock padding for top-bottom and left-right margin](../assets/content-design-shared/content-components-styles-padding-locked.png){width="250"}

* **Independent** - To set padding for each side to an independent value, set the _Unlocked_ icon between the top and bottom settings and between the left and right. For each setting, click the up and down arrow icons for either to increase or decrease the number of pixels.

   ![Set independent padding](../assets/content-design-shared/content-components-styles-padding-unlocked.png){width="250"}

## Content components - size styles {#styles-size}

On the right panel with the _[!UICONTROL Styles]_ tab selected, expand the **[!UICONTROL Size]** section and set the options for the component height and width:

* **[!UICONTROL Height]** - Click the up and down arrow icons to increase or decrease the number of pixels. An empty value (Auto) is the default and sizes the height of the element according to its contents.

* **[!UICONTROL Width]** - Use the toggle to set the width by pixels or percentage.

   * For a percentage width, use the slider to set the percentage value. The percentage determines the element size based on the content box of the containing block, which excludes padding and borders. For example, a value of 50 sets the element width to 50% of its containing block content width.

     ![Width style using percentage](../assets/content-design-shared/content-components-styles-size-width-percent.png){width="250"}

   * For a pixel-based width, click the up and down arrow icons to increase or decrease the number of pixels. An empty value (Auto) is the default and sizes the width of the element according to its contents.

     ![Width style using pixels](../assets/content-design-shared/content-components-styles-size-width-pixels.png){width="250"}

## Content components - text styles {#styles-text}
