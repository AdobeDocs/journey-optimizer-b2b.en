The following example outlines steps to adjust padding and vertical alignment inside a structure component composed of columns.

1. Select the column in the structure component directly in the canvas or using the _Navigation tree_ displayed at the left.

1. From the column toolbar, click the _[!UICONTROL Select a column]_ tool and choose the one that you want to edit.

   You can also select it from the structure tree. The editable parameters for that column are displayed in the _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ and _[!UICONTROL Styles]_ tabs on the right.

1. To edit the column properties, click the _[!UICONTROL Styles]_ tab on the right and change them according to your needs:

   * For **[!UICONTROL Background]**, change the background color as needed.

      Clear the check box for a transparent background. Enable the **[!UICONTROL Background image]** setting to use an image as the background instead of a solid color.

   * For **[!UICONTROL Alignment]**, select the _Top_, _Middle_, or _Bottom_ icon.
   * For **[!UICONTROL Padding]**, define the padding for all sides.
