# Content authoring - custom CSS

1. In the _Styles_ tab that is displayed on the right, click **[!UICONTROL Add custom CSS]**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The **[!UICONTROL Add custom CSS]** button is available only when the _[!UICONTROL Body]_ component is selected. However, you can apply custom CSS styles to all the components within it.

    The _[!UICONTROL Add custom CSS]_ pop-up editor is displayed with placeholder code comments.

1. Enter your CSS code in the editor.

   Make sure that the custom CSS is valid and follows the proper syntax. If the entered CSS is invalid, an error message is displayed and the CSS cannot be saved. To learn more, see [CSS validity](../user/content/design-custom-css.md#css-validity).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the custom CSS.

   The custom style sheet is applied to the existing content. You can check that your custom CSS is applied according to your needs. For information about how to make changes and adjust the style sheet application, see [Troubleshooting](../user/content/design-custom-css.md#troubleshooting).

>[!NOTE]
>
>  If you remove all content, the CSS section no longer appears in the body styles panel and the previously defined custom CSS is no longer applied. If you add content back, the **[!UICONTROL CSS styles]** section reappears and the custom CSS is applied again.
