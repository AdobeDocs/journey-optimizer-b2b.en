# Content authoring - import HTML

Imported content can be:

* An HTML file with an incorporated style sheet
* A .zip folder that includes an HTML file, the style sheet (.css), and image files

>[!NOTE]
>
>There are no constraints on the .zip file structure. However, references must be relative and fit with the tree structure of the .zip folder.

_To import a file containing HTML content:_

1. From the Email Designer home page, select **[!UICONTROL Import HTML]**.

1. Drag and drop the HTML or .zip file containing your HTML content and click [!UICONTROL Import].

   When the HTML content upload is complete, your content is in _Compatibility mode_. In this mode, you can only personalize your text, add links, or include assets to your content.
