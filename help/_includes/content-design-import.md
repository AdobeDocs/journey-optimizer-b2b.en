# Content authoring - import HTML

Imported content can be:

* An HTML file with an incorporated style sheet
* A .zip file that includes an HTML file, the style sheet (.css), and images

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >There are no constraints on the .zip file structure. However, references must be relative and fit with the tree structure of the .zip folder. The images are always uploaded to the connected Marketo Engage assets repository. If you want to manage the image files in Experience Manager Assets, upload them separately in that app interface and change the image links in the email designer. 

_To import a file containing HTML content:_

1. From the _[!UICONTROL Design your template]_ home page, select the **[!UICONTROL Import HTML]** option.

1. Drag and drop the HTML or .zip file containing your HTML content and click **[!UICONTROL Import]**.
