# Content authoring - import HTML

Imported content can be:

* An HTML file with an incorporated style sheet
* A .zip file that includes an HTML file, the style sheet (.css), and images

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >There are no constraints on the .zip file structure. However, references must be relative and fit with the tree structure of the .zip folder.

_To import a file containing HTML content:_

1. From the _[!UICONTROL Design your template]_ home page, select the **[!UICONTROL Import HTML]** option.

1. Drag and drop the HTML or .zip file containing your HTML content and click **[!UICONTROL Import]**.

   After the HTML content is uploaded, your content is in _Compatibility mode_. In this mode, you can only personalize your text, add links, or include assets to your content.
