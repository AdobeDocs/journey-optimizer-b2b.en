# Content authoring - components

1. To start your content design, drag an item from the **[!UICONTROL Structures]** and drop it onto the canvas.

   Repeat this step for each structure component to construct the layout of your email.

1. Add as many items from _[!UICONTROL Structures]_ as you need and edit the settings for each in the pane on the right.

   Select the n:n column component to define the number of columns of your choice (between three and 10). You can also define the width of each column by moving the arrows below the column.

   Each column size cannot be less than 10% of the total width of the structure component. Only empty columns can be removed.

1. Expand the **[!UICONTROL Contents]** section and add as many elements as you need into one or more structure components. 

1. If needed, you can make additional customizations for each component in the _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ or _[!UICONTROL Style]_ tabs.

   For example, you can change the text style, padding or margin of each component.

1. From the Asset picker, you can directly select assets stored in the Assets library.

   Double-click the folder that contains your assets. Drag and drop the items into a structure component.

1. Insert personalization fields to customize your content from profiles attributes, audience memberships, Contextual attributes, and more. 

<!-- 1. Click **[!UICONTROL Enable condition content]** to add dynamic content and adapt the content to the targeted profiles based on conditional rules.
-->
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Links]** tab from the left pane to display all the URLs of your content that are tracked.

   You can modify the _Tracking Type_ or _Label_ and add tags if needed.
