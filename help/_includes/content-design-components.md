# Content authoring - components

1. To start your content design, drag an item from the **[!UICONTROL Structures]** and drop it onto the canvas.

   Add as many items from _[!UICONTROL Structures]_ as you need and edit the settings for each in the pane on the right.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Select the _[!UICONTROL n:n column]_ component to define the number of columns of your choice (between three and 10). You can also define the width of each column by moving the arrows below the column.

   ![Drag a structure onto the canvas and adjust the settings](../assets/content-design-shared/content-design-add-structure.png){width="800" zoomable="yes"}

   Each column size cannot be less than 10% of the total width of the structure component. Only empty columns can be removed.

1. Expand the **[!UICONTROL Contents]** section and add as many elements as you need into one or more structure components.
