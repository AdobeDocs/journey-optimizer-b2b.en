# Journey nodes

After you create a journey (account journey or person journey), add the audience and build out the journey using nodes. The journey map provides a canvas, where you can build your multistep B2B marketing use cases.

Audience nodes are automtically the first node in the journey:

* [Account audience](./account-audience-nodes.md)
* [Person audience](./person-audience-nodes.md) (Beta)

Build your journey by combining the different action, event, and orchestration nodes as a multi-step, cross-channel scenario. Each node of a journey represents a step along a logical path. Use the following node types to construct an account journey:

* [Take an action](./action-nodes.md)
* [Listen for an event](./listen-for-event-nodes.md)
* [Split paths](./split-merge-paths-nodes.md)
* [Wait](./wait-nodes.md)
* [Merge paths](./split-merge-paths-nodes.md)
