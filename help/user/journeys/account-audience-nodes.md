# Account audience journey nodes

The Account Audience node defines the input account audience (created and managed in Adobe Experience Platform) for the journey. When you [create an account journey](./journey-overview.md#create-an-account-journey), it always starts with an _Account Audience_ node where you can add input to your journey.

_To set the audience for the node:_
   
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Account audience]** node to display the node properties on the right.
