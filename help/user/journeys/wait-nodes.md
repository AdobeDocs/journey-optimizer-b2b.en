# Wait nodes

Use a _Wait_ node when you want to pause the journey progression for a certain duration before moving to the next step.

There are two ways that you can define the wait time:

* A relative duration (number of minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months)
* A specific date when you want to move forward to the next node in the journey

_To define a wait node for your account journey:_

1. Navigate to the journey map.

1. Click the plus ( **+** ) icon on a path and choose **[!UICONTROL Wait]**.

1. In the node properties on the right, set the **[!UICONTROL Type]** of time to wait before the journey proceeds to the next node in the path.
