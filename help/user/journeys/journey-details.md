# Journey details

When you click the name for an active account journey, the journey details are displayed. The _[!UICONTROL Overview]_ tab provides useful information about the journey, including generative AI summaries.

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of a selected account journey, detailing account progress using circle and line charts that categorize and quantify completions, in-progress activities, and aborts over time. It helps Marketers evaluate the effectiveness of Email and SMS channels through key delivery and engagement metrics.

This overview is available for published account journeys, and it takes approximately four hours for data to start populating the charts and tables.
