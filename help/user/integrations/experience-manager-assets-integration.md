# Adobe Experience Manager Assets integration

Bring marketing and creative workflows together using Adobe Experience Manager Assets. It is natively integrated with Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, so you can easily access Assets as a Cloud Service to discover and use digital assets. It provides access to your Assets repository for assets that you can use to populate your messages.

Adobe Experience Manager Assets can connect to Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service for centralized asset workspaces that extend your creative system and unify digital assets for experience delivery. Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service offers an easy-to-use cloud solution for efficient Digital Asset Management and Dynamic Media operations. It seamlessly incorporates advanced features, including Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Learn more in the [Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/overview).

Adobe Experience Manager Assets can be accessed directly within Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition from the **[!UICONTROL Assets]** item in the left navigation.

Depending on your contract, Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service can be accessed directly from Adobe Journey Optimizer through the left menu Assets section. You can also access assets and folders when designing an email content.

Currently, you can only use images from Adobe Experience Manager Assets in Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition.

## Using the Marketo Engage DAM bundled repository

If you are provisioned with a Marketo Engage account and Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Services, you have access to the repositories for both Marketo Engage DAM and Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service when your user account has the required permissions. These repositories are separate and not in sync. You can only use one of them at a time, and it requires an administrator to switch from the Marketo Engage DAM to Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service. The _[!UICONTROL Assets]_ item in the left navigation displays the repository that is currently set.

## Asset management

When Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service is integrated with Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, the latest changes in Assets as a Cloud Service automatically propagate to live email campaigns through linked references. If images are deleted in Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service, the images appear with a broken reference in the emails.

When assets that are currently under use in Journeys are modified or deleted, the journey authors are notified about the image changes and the list of journeys using the image. All changes to the assets must be done in the Adobe Experience Manager Assets central repository.
