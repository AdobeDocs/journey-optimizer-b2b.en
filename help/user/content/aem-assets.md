# Work with Experience Manager assets

When Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service is integrated with Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, you can easily discover and access digital assets for use in your marketing content. As you author your content, the assets are accessible from the _Experience Manager Assets_ item on the left navigation, and when authoring email content for an account journey. You can also upload assets to connected AEM Assets as a Cloud Service repository directly from Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Currently, only image assets from Adobe Experience Manager Assets are supported in Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition. Changes to the assets must be done from the Adobe Experience Manager Assets central repository. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/manage-digital-assets)

When you use these digital assets, the latest changes in Assets as a Cloud Service automatically propagate to live email campaigns through linked references. If images are deleted in Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service, the images appear with a broken reference in the emails. When assets that are currently used within account journeys are modified or deleted, the journey authors are notified about the image changes and the list of journeys using the image. All changes to the assets must be done in the Adobe Experience Manager Assets central repository.

When your environment has one or more [Assets repositories connections](../admin/configure-aem-repositories.md), content authors can use AEM Assets as the source for assets when creating an email, email template, or visual fragment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>An administrator must add users who need access to Assets to the Assets Consumer Users or/and Assets Users Product profiles. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/security/ims-support#managing-products-and-user-access-in-admin-console)
