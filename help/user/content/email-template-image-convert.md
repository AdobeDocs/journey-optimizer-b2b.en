# Convert an image to an email template

Creating and updating email templates is a foundational component in your Marketing content supply chain, but these tasks often require significant time and resources because of manual HTML coding. Marketing teams have traditionally relied on agencies or IT teams to develop these templates. The new image-to-HTML tool for email templates simplifies this process by allowing marketers to convert design files into HTML code templates. The converted HTML is ready for further editing in the email design space. This tool supports both JPEG and PNG file types and features a drag-and-drop interface.

You can easily convert design files saved as images (PNG or JPEG) into email template-ready HTML, saving your web team valuable time and resources. The intuitive template generator converts images to HTML-coded email templates that are ready for modification with the email design tools. A marketer or design professional can upload an image and quickly generate an email template, without the need for manual HTML coding. This tool supports conversion from JPEG and PNG file types into HTML-coded email templates.

**Using a brand theme**

If your organization has [brand themes](./brand-themes.md) defined in Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, you can select a brand theme as input so that the generated output HTML is styled according to the brand theme parameters. With this input, styling such as background color, button color, fonts, line spacing, margins, padding are applied to the generated template.  Using a brand theme helps to eliminate additional design work for styling and formatting and produces a template that is ready to use with minimal edits.
