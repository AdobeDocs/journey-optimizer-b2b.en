# Emails

When you [create emails](./add-email.md), you add them in the context of a journey node. When you want to work with email content outside of the journey map, use the _[!UICONTROL Emails]_ list to locate and update the email. You can review emails or make updates to the settings and content.

## Access and manage emails

To access emails in Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, go to the left navigation and click **[!UICONTROL Content Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Emails]**. This action opens a listing page with all the emails created for the instance listed in a table.

The table is sorted by the _[!UICONTROL Modified]_ column by default, with the most recently updated emails at the top. Click the column title to change between ascending and descending.

To search for an email by name, enter a text string in the search bar. Click the _Filter_ ( ![Filter icon](../assets/do-not-localize/icon-filter.svg) ) icon at the top left to filter the displayed emails by creation and modification dates. You can also limit the list to the emails that you have created or modified.

## Open and edit emails

Click the email name in the list to open it. You can review and change the [email settings](./add-email.md#define-the-email-settings). Click **[!UICONTROL Edit email content]** to make [updates to the content](./email-authoring.md). 

If [alerts are displayed](./add-email.md#check-alerts) at the top-right of the page, click to review the warnings or errors and address the items as needed.

You can also access the [_[!UICONTROL Simulate content]_](./email-simulate-content.md) window. Use these tools to preview the content using a test profile, send proofs, and test the email for deliverability and email client rendering.
