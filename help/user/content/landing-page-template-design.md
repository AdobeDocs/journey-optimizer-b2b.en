# Landing page template design

After you [create a landing page template](./landing-page-templates.md#create-a-landing-page-template), use the visual design space to author the structural and content components in your page template.

## Add structure and content {#structure-content-landing-page}

{{$include /help/_includes/content-design-components.md}}

### Add custom CSS

You can add your own custom CSS directly within the landing page design space. Use custom CSS to apply advanced and specific styling, for greater flexibility and control over the appearance of your content. It is a best practice to add this highest-level styling before you include components, such as images, buttons, and text.

With at least one content component in the canvas, select the **[!UICONTROL Body]** component in the left navigation tree to access the custom CSS editor.

### Add assets

{{$include /help/_includes/content-design-assets.md}}

### Add forms

{{$include /help/_includes/content-design-add-forms.md}}

### Navigate the layers, settings, and styles

{{$include /help/_includes/content-design-navigation.md}}

### Personalize content

{{$include /help/_includes/content-design-personalization.md}}

### Edit linked URL tracking

{{$include /help/_includes/content-design-links.md}}

### Save your work

Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** at any time to save the landing page template.
<!--
You can continue to make edits to the draft page template. When you are ready to make it available for using in page creation, you can [publish the template](./landing-page-templates.md#). -->

### View options

Leverage the view and content validation options that are available in the visual design space.

* Zoom in/out on the content across preset zoom options.

* Switch viewing the content across Desktop, Mobile, or Text-only/Plain-text.
   * Click the _View_ icon for content preview across devices.
   * Select one of the out-of-the-box devices or enter custom dimensions to preview the content.

### More options

From the _[!UICONTROL More ...]_ menu at the top of the visual design space, you can take the following actions:

![Click More to access template actions](./assets/landing-page-designer-more-menu.png){width="500"}

* **[!UICONTROL Reset landing page]** - Click this option to clear the visual design canvas to a blank slate and restart building your page content.
* **[!UICONTROL Change your design]** - Return to the _[!UICONTROL Create your primary landing page]_ home page. From there, you can choose another template to restart the design process, or choose to design the page from scratch in a blank canvas.
<!--- * **[!UICONTROL Save as content template]** - Save the page body as a landing page template to be reused across multiple landing pages. You provide a name and description for the template and save it to the list of saved  landing page templates. -->
