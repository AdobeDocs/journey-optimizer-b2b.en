Use the _Structure components_ in the design space to define the structure of your contents. By adding and moving structural elements with simple drag-and-drop actions, you can quickly define the shape of your contents. Each structure component provides a section where you can add the content components.

## Structure library

The **[!UICONTROL Structure]** section at the top of the Components library displays the available content components:
