# Email template authoring

After you [create an email template](./email-templates.md#create-an-email-template), use the visual design space to author the structural and content components in your email template. 

## Add structure and content {#structure-content}

>id="ajo-b2b_structure_components_template"
>title="Add Structure components"
>abstract="Structure components define the layout of the template. Drag and drop a **Structure** component into the canvas to start designing the content for your template."

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="ajo-b2b_content_components_template"
>title="About Content components"
>abstract="Content components are empty content placeholders that you can use to create the layout of a template."

### Add custom CSS

You can add your own custom CSS directly within the email template design space. Use custom CSS to apply advanced and specific styling, for greater flexibility and control over the appearance of your content. It is a best practice to add this highest-level styling before you include components such as images, buttons, and text.

With at least one content component in the canvas, select the **[!UICONTROL Body]** component in the left navigation tree to access the custom CSS editor.
