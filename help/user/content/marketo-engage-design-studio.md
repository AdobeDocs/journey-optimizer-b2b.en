# Work with Marketo Engage assets

Marketo Engage Design Studio is the default asset source for Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, and you can easily manage and use the available assets to design content that supports your account journeys.

In Marketo Engage, marketing organizations use workspaces to organize their content assets and help teams to access the correct asset. Well-defined workspaces are especially helpful for large enterprises that have a large portfolio of product offerings, or operate globally with different requirements for marketing to different regions.

## Central asset management

By default, there is a **_[!UICONTROL Journey Optimizer B2B Edition]_** workspace that you can use specifically for your account journey content. The assets that you add to this workspace are not visible or available for use in Marketo Engage. For assets residing in this workspace, you have the full range of asset management functions in Journey Optimizer B2B Edition. These functions include:

* [Replace](#replace-assets)
* [Delete](#delete-assets)
* [Move](#create-a-folder)
* [Edit with Adobe Express](./image-edit-adobe-express.md)

Assets residing in the Marketo Engage workspaces are limited to read-only access for use in emails, email templates, and fragments. You can add new assets to these workspaces and download a copy of an asset.

## Browse and access assets

To access Adobe Marketo Engage assets from Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, go to the left navigation and click **[!UICONTROL Content Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Assets]**. This action opens a listing page with all the assets listed.

![Browse Marketo Engage assets](assets/assets-list-page.png){width="800" zoomable="yes"}

The Journey Optimizer B2B Edition workspace is selected by default. The other workspaces are listed below.

* To view the assets by workspace and folder, open the structure by clicking the _Show Folders_ icon on the top left.

* To sort the table by any of the columns, click the column title. The arrow in the title row indicates the current sort column and order.

* To search for an image asset within the selected workspace or folder, enter a text string in the search bar.

* To customize the columns that are displayed in the table, click the _Customize table_ icon ( ![Customize table](../assets/do-not-localize/icon-column-settings.svg) ) on the top right.

   Select the columns that you want to display in the listing and click **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.

## View asset details

Click the name of any asset to open the asset details page.

![Access asset details](assets/assets-details.png){width="700" zoomable="yes"}

## View asset used-by references

Within the asset details page, click the **[!UICONTROL Used By]** tab to view details of where the asset is currently used within Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, across emails, email templates, and fragments.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Any asset that is currently _IN USE_ in any of the emails, email templates, or fragments **cannot** be deleted.

The panel displays the references by category: _Email_, _Email template_, or _Fragment_. Emails in Journey Optimizer B2B Edition are embedded and authored within journeys, so the parent journey of the email that uses the asset is displayed in references.

Clicking the link directs you to the corresponding email, email template, or fragment where the asset is used.
