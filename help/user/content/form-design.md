# Form design

After you [create a form](./landing-pages.md#create-a-landing-page), the visual design space opens a draft with a default basic form definition. In the _[!UICONTROL Summary]_ panel on the right, click **[!UICONTROL Edit form]** and use the visual design space to define the form styling and field components.

## Fields

Form fields are used to capture person profile data that can be used to target people and associate them with accounts and buying groups. All new forms start with the following fields in a single column layout:

* First name
* Last name
* Email address

Use the field design tools to construct the set of fields and layout that you need for gathering the data that you need for your account-based marketing activities.

### Add a field {#add-field}

1. In the _[!UICONTROL Components]_ panel on the left, drag the **[!UICONTROL Field]** content component and drop it onto the canvas.

   ![Add a field component to the form](./assets/form-content-add-field.png){width="700" zoomable="yes"}

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Select field attribute]**.

1. In the _[!UICONTROL Select field attribute]_ dialog, select the checkbox for the person profile attribute that you want to use for the field and click **[!UICONTROL Select]**.

   The [XDM business schemas](../data/field-mapping.md#xdm-business-person-attributes) determine the available attributes.  Any custom fields that are defined for your Journey Optimizer B2B Edition instance are also available. Use the Search text box to filter the list by name, or click the Filter icon to filter the list by schema/data type. 

   ![Add a field component to the form](./assets/form-field-select-attribute-filtered.png){width="700" zoomable="yes"}

   On the canvas, the default field label for the selected attribute is populated on the canvas. The **[!UICONTROL Field details]** are displayed in the panel on the right.

1. If needed, change the **[!UICONTROL Label]** text. 

   This text is displayed next to the field in the form. The default text is populated from the field attribute.

1. Set **[!UICONTROL Field type]** according to the type of data for the field:

   | Field type | Usage | Example |
   | ---------- | ----- | ------- |
   | **[!UICONTROL Checkbox]** | Use this type so that visitors can select a _true_ (checked) or _false_ (unchecked) value. | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Checkbox Group]** | Use this type so that visitors can select a _true_ (checked) or _false_ (unchecked) value for multiple items. | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Currency]** | Use this type to allow a float field that represents the default currency type selected for the Journey Optimizer B2B Edition instance. | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Date]** | Use this type to restrict entry to a date format and provide a calendar selector in the field. | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Double]** |  | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Email]**  |  Use this type to restrict entry to an email address format. | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Number]** | Use this type to restrict the field to a numerical value. | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Radio Group]** | Use this type to allow visitors to select one of a set of options. | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Select]** | Use this type to allow visitors to select one of a set of options using a drop-down list. | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Slider]** | Use this type to allow visitors to set a numeric value using a slider. | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Telephone]** | Use this type for a telephone number entry field.  | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Text]** | Use this type for a standard text (string) entry field. | |
   | **[!UICONTROL Textarea]** | Use this type to support longer text entry.  | |
   | **[!UICONTROL URL]** | Use this type to restrict text input to a URL, including the standard URL protocol. | |

1. Depending on the selected field type, set the other options for the field entry and validation:

   ![Set options for the field according to the selected field type](./assets//form-field-details-text-type.png){width="400" zoomable="yes"}

   * **[!UICONTROL Placeholder]** - The placeholder value for the field that gives the visitor an example of what is expected for the field.

   * **[!UICONTROL Instructions]** - Instructive text that helps the visitor to complete the field. Enter the text that you want to display as _hover text_ for the field.

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >_Instructions vs. placeholder text_<br/>
      >
      >Use these two properties to guide visitors for filling out the field. Instruction text appears as a tool tip/popup text when hovering the pointer over the field. Placeholder text appears _dimmed_ inside the field and disappears as the visitor engers their text into the field. You can use both methods, or just one.

   * **[!UICONTROL Default value]** - Use this option to specify a default value for the field. 

   * **[!UICONTROL Validation message]** - Use this option to specify a validation message for the field. This message is displayed if the visitor enters an invalid value for the field. The _[!UICONTROL Standard]_ message is set by default. Choose **[!UICONTROL Custom]** and enter your own message. 

   * **Max length** - Enter the maximum number of characters that can be entered into the field.

1. Set the **[!UICONTROL Field behaviors]** as needed: 

   * **Required** - Select the checkbox to make the field input required for submitting the form.

   * **Enable input mask** - Select the checkbox to restrict input from your visitor using an input mask. For example, you may want visitors to enter phone numbers in a specific format. In the dialog, enter the mask using `9` for any number, `a` for any letter, and `*` for either. Click Save to enable the specified input mask.
