# Intent data

In Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, the Intent Detection model predicts a solution/product of interest with high enough confidence based on a lead's activity. It also leverages other account co-members' activities, along with tagged content. The intent of a person can be interpreted as the probability of having interest in a product. 

* Levels of intent - Available on known lead, account, and buying group level.
* Types of intent signal -  Keywords, product, and solution

To activate this feature, you can submit a list of keywords in a spreadsheet to your Adobe account manager. These keywords are used for your content tagging.

A set of keywords (up to 20) can be associated with a product. A set of products (up to 20) can be associated with a category. You can have a maximum of 20 categories. This whole model is achieved through a simple spreadsheet that is ingested. The spreadsheet can contain a single tab that correlates to the product name and it can contain one column that correlates to a list of keywords.

You can add multiple tabs, each with a product name and the entire spreadsheet can correlate to a category.
