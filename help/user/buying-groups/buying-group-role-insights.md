## [!UICONTROL Role acquisition over time]

As marketing and sales teams acquire new people, drive engagement, and enrich data, new members of the buying group become qualified. This report shows how those efforts translate into newly qualified buying group members, broken down by role. Each time someone is added to a buying group, the report records that addition under the corresponding role.
