# Solution interests

Before you create buying groups, you should know what you are selling and who you want to target. Your marketing and sales strategy should be aligned so that you can add the solution interest for the buying groups.

   The tab provides an inventory list of all existing solution interests. It displays the following information in column format: _[!UICONTROL Name]_, _[!UICONTROL Roles template]_, _[!UICONTROL Buying group creation jobs]_, _[!UICONTROL Last updated on]_, _[!UICONTROL Updated by]_, _[!UICONTROL Created on]_, and _[!UICONTROL Created by]_

   The list is sorted by the _[!UICONTROL Last updated on]_ column by default. Click the column title in the header to toggle the sort between descending and ascending.
   
## View and delete buying group jobs

On the _[!UICONTROL Solution interest]_ tab, the **[!UICONTROL Buying group creation jobs]** column displays the count of jobs created for each solution interest. Click the number to open a dialog that displays the list of jobs created for the solution interest.

You can delete a buying group job by clicking the ellipsis (...) next to the job name and choosing **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

## Create a solution interest

Before you create a solution interest, you must have a live (published) roles template that defines the roles you want to target. See [Buying Group role templates](./buying-groups-role-templates.md) for more information about creating a roles template and publishing a roles template.

1. From the _[!UICONTROL Solution Interest]_ tab, click **[!UICONTROL Create solution interest]** at the top-right.

1. Enter a unique **[!UICONTROL Name]** (required) and a **[!UICONTROL Description]** (optional).

1. Choose a **[!UICONTROL Roles Template]** (required).

   Click **[!UICONTROL Select roles template]** and choose a live roles template from the list in the dialog. You can associate only one live roles template with a solution interest. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to return to the _[!UICONTROL Create solution interest]_ page, where the selected roles template is displayed.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Buying group stage model]** to use buying group stage progression (optional).

   For more information about using buying group stages for tracking account progression, see [Buying group stages](./buying-group-stages.md).

1. Enable the **[!UICONTROL Update existing buying groups]** setting (optional).

   When this option is enabled, all the existing buying groups paired with the solution interest are updated through the 7-day sync cycle.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]** at the top-right corner.

   The new solution interest is displayed in the _[!UICONTROL Solution Interests]_ list.

## Edit a solution interest

At any time, you can change the name and description for a solution interest. The roles template cannot be changed due to the dependency of buying groups based on the solution interest and role template pairing. In this case, you must create a new solution interest using another roles template.

1. From the _[!UICONTROL Solution interest]_ tab, use one of the following methods to open the properties for the solution interest that you want to edit:

   * Click the solution interest name.
   * Click the ellipsis (**...**) next to it and choose **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.

1. Make any needed updates to the solution interest settings:

   * Update the **[!UICONTROL Name]** and **[!UICONTROL Description]**.

   * Select the **[!UICONTROL Buying group stage model]** that is used for tracking buying group stage progression.

      For more information about using buying group stages for tracking journey progression against sales, see [Buying group stages](./buying-group-stages.md).

   * Change the **[!UICONTROL Update existing buying groups]** setting.

      When this option is enabled, all the existing buying groups paired with the solution interest are updated through the 7-day sync cycle.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Delete a solution interest

Any solution interest that is currently in-use by any buying group job or account journey cannot be deleted. Also, a deleted solution interest cannot be retrieved.

1. From the _[!UICONTROL Solution interest]_ tab, click the ellipsis (**...**) next to the solution interest and choose **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

   This action opens a confirmation dialog.

   If the solution interest is currently in use by an account journey or buying group job, the action results in an alert that it cannot be deleted. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**, which aborts the deletion.
   
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Delete]** to confirm deletion, or you can abort the process by clicking _[!UICONTROL Cancel]_.
