# Default and custom roles

Journey Optimizer B2B Edition includes a set of default roles that are used in roles templates for buying groups. But many organizations require custom roles that they can define according to their business goals and strategies. You can use the _[!UICONTROL Roles]_ list to create your own role definitions that support your buying groups.

## Access roles

1. On the left navigation, click **[!UICONTROL Buying groups]**.

1. In the _[!UICONTROL Buying groups]_ page, select the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** tab.

   The tab provides an inventory list of all existing roles and displays the following information in column format:

   * [!UICONTROL Name] - The role name.
   * [!UICONTROL Type] - All roles have a type of `Default` or `Custom`.
   * [!UICONTROL Created on] - For a custom role, the date and time the role was created.
   * [!UICONTROL Created by] - For a custom role, the user who created the role.
   * [!UICONTROL Last updated on] - For a custom role, the date and time the role was last updated.
   * [!UICONTROL Updated by] - For a custom role, the user who last updated the role.

   The list displays the default roles at the top:

   * Decision Maker
   * Influencer
   * Practitioner
   * Executive Steering Committee
   * Champion
   * Other

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You cannot change or delete the default roles. There is a maximum limit of 20 roles, including default and custom roles.

## Create a custom role

1. From the _[!UICONTROL Roles]_ tab, click **[!UICONTROL Create Role]** at the top-right corner.

1. In the dialog, enter a unique **[!UICONTROL Name]** (required) and **[!UICONTROL Description]** (optional) for the role.
