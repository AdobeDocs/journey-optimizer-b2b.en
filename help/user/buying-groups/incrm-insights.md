# In-CRM Insights

The Marketo In-CRM Insights is a web-base application that integrates into Salesforce, giving you access to your AJO B2B buying groups directly within Salesforce. This allows you to identify opportunities for increased engagement and sales potential.

The In-CRM Insights is available in the [Marketo Sales Insights package](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-for-salesforce/installation/install-marketo-sales-insight-package-in-salesforce-appexchange).

## Using In-CRM Insights

In-CRM Insights is available in Salesforce through the App Launcher.

1. Click on the App Launcher in Salesforce.
1. Select or search for `Journey Optimizer B2B Edition`.
1. In the tab that opens, login with your Adobe credentials.
1. Choose a sandbox that hosts your Account Journeys from the dropdown.

Your Buying Groups are loaded and available. Data is read-only through In-CRM Insights.

>[!NOTE]
>Users must be a member of the [B2B Sales User](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer-b2b/user/admin/user-management#add-users-to-a-role) role to access In-CRM Insights.
