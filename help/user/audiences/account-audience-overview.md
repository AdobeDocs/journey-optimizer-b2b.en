# Account Audiences

An audience is a set of people who share similar behaviors and/or characteristics. In Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, account audiences are used as an input for account-based destinations, allowing you to target the people within those accounts in downstream services. For example, you can use account audiences to retrieve records of all the accounts that do not have contact information for any people with the title Chief Operating Officer (COO) or Chief Marketing Officer (CMO).

Learn more about audiences in the [Adobe Experience Platform Segmentation Service documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/home).

Journey Optimizer B2B Edition allows you to build Adobe Experience Platform account audiences directly from the left navigation, and leverage them into your account journeys.
