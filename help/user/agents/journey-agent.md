The more detail that you can provide, the better the reply will be. If you have existing marketing materials that describe the event, or your product, etc., paste that into the prompt, so the Agent has a better sense of the goal.

"Act as a B2B journey strategist to create a multi-stage customer account journey that nurtures and engages decision-makers and marketing personas in the early exploration phase of `Solution Name`. The goal is to convert anonymous visitors into known contacts, deepen engagement with relevant content on `domain`.com, and prime qualified leads for `Product Name` sales outreach. Use channels such as email and paid media, leveraging existing audience segments and content. Structure the journey across awareness, consideration, and evaluation stages over 4–6 weeks, with clear triggers, actions, and goals for each stage. Include KPIs like conversion rates, engagement scores, and demo requests, and return the output as a structured journey flow."

This detailed prompt provides:

* Clear Intent: What do you want the AI to do? Be specific about the task or outcome.
* Context-Rich: Provide relevant background or constraints. Include examples or references if possible.
* Structured Format: Use bullet points, numbered steps, or templates.
