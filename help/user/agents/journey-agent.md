* Increasing efficiency in light of tighter budgets

* RECOMMEND - Leverage past marketing engagement and other historical data to optimize journey creation
* OPTIMIZE - Analyze, adjust, and optimize active journeys based on predictions or actual performance
* MANAGE - Prioritize, manage, and orchestrate overlapping journeys and message delivery

## First release

### End-to-end B2B Journey Creation (Account or Person Journey) from text files or prompt.

The Journey Agent can generate an end-to-end journey flow (account or person journey) from natural language text prompts and metadata, through a conversational experience rather than a tradition user interface.

End-to-end Journey prompt examples:

* Create a cross-channel journey to nurture accounts that have not engaged with my content in the past 30 days.
* Create a journey to cross-sell a solution to accounts showing high intent with no open pipeline by providing personalized content for the most important buying group roles.
* Create a B2B journey to invite decision makers to a roadshow in engaged accounts most likely to open new pipeline.
* Create a journey for whitespace accounts with intent for my solution, focusing on people engaged with content on the website.

### Multi-stage jouneys

You can act as a B2B journey designer to create a multi-stage customer account journey that informs decision-makers and marketing personas early in the exploration phase.
The goal is to convert anonymous visitors into known contacts, deepen engagement with relevant content, and prime qualified leads for sales outreach.

* Use channels such as `Email`, `Paid media`, `Personalized web experiences` to leverage existing audience segments and content.
* Structure the journey across a`wareness`, `consideration`, and `evaluation` stages over 4â€“6 weeks, with clear triggers, actions, and goals for each stage.
* Include KPIs such as `conversion rates`, `engagement scores`, and `demo requests`, and return the output as a structured journey flow.
