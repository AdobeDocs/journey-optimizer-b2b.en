# Journey Build Agent for B2B

The Journey Agent in Journey Optimizer B2B Edition tackles three of the key challenges facing B2B marketers today:

* Dealing with increasingly complex customer journeys (complexity in audience, content & messaging, and omnichannel)
* Increasing efficiency in light of tighter budgets
* Figuring out how the optimal customer journey should be structured

Jobs to be done:

* CREATE - Translate marketing objectives, products to focus on, engagement strategy, timeline, messaging, channels, content & offers, and KPIs into a personalized customer journey with automation and conditions
* RECOMMEND - Leverage past marketing engagement and other historical data to optimize journey creation
* OPTIMIZE - Analyze, adjust, and optimize active journeys based on predictions or actual performance
* MANAGE - Prioritize, manage, and orchestrate overlapping journeys and message delivery

## First release

### End-to-end B2B Journey Creation (Account or Person Journey) from text files or prompt.

The Journey Agent can generate an end-to-end journey flow (account or person journey) from natural language text prompts and metadata, through a conversational experience rather than a tradition user interface.

End-to-end Journey prompt examples:

* Create a cross-channel journey to nurture accounts that have not engaged with my content in the past 30 days.
* Create a journey to cross-sell a solution to accounts showing high intent with no open pipeline by providing personalized content for the most important buying group roles.
* Create a B2B journey to invite decision makers to a roadshow in engaged accounts most likely to open new pipeline.
* Create a journey for whitespace accounts with intent for my solution, focusing on people engaged with content on the website.
