Built alongside Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B (AJO B2B) and the Adobe Agent Orchestrator framework, this solution intelligently integrates data, orchestration, and generative AI capabilities to empower Business Development Representatives (BDRs) with the following skills:

* **Automated account intelligence**

   * Leverage unified customer profiles and real-time signals to generate instant, context-rich summaries of target accounts and associated buying groups, enabling faster and more informed outreach

   * Conduct prospect research using automatic retrieval and display of key prospect information (such as job title, recent engagements, buying group membership) to provide a complete picture in seconds.

   * Conduct account research using automatic retrieval and display of detailed information about a prospect's organizationThis information includes company vitals, recent news, strategic priorities, and top engaged members.

   * Generate email drafts by synthesizing research from prospect and account insights to produce relevant, personalized single email content based on the BDR's objective.

   * Create engagement plan email drafts that are personalized  for each step of a BDR-defined outreach cadence, ensuring the entire sequence is personalized

* **Generative outreach**

    Use the large language models (LLMs) to draft highly personalized multi-channel outreach messages (currently limited to email). Your prompts are dynamically tailored based on account insights, past interactions, and industry-specific context.

* **Autonomous engagement**

    Support automated follow-up and response handling by intelligently interpreting customer replies and continuing conversations until the lead is qualified or routed. This autonomous engagement reduces human dependency while ensuring timeliness.

* **Data hygiene and enrichment**

    Automatically sync updates back to the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system with enriched company data. This sync includes company details and intent signals, ensuring accurate, up-to-date records and minimizing the burden of manual data entry.

This intelligent agent system enhances scalability, maintains contextual awareness across interactions, and integrates seamlessly into the BDR toolchain â€” enabling BDRs to focus on high-value conversations rather than repetitive tasks.

## Basic Usage

Adobe AI agents use _natural language queries_, which means that they use the same language in the text prompt as you would in speaking with a person. The more detailed you are, the better the results.

Using natural language, you can ask the agent to:

* Show me my assigned leads with no engagement yet
* Show me all my leads that are not part of any autonomous engagement
* Give me a detailed summary on `<company>`, including their buying group, recent intent signals, and our past engagement.

You can immediately understand which accounts and leads are most active and show the highest intent, so you can focus your energy where it has the most impact.

Iterate over your journey by refining your prompts to get the results you need. For example:

* Draft a follow-up email drawing from context like earnings calls or reports. Up to 120 words. Subject line: Captivating, incorporating a key theme. Intro: Hook with a direct quote from context sources. Body: Connect to pain points and value propositions. CTA: Propose a short call to explore further.

* The goal of this email is to start a conversation and build credibility. Draft an email under 120 words that has a consultative and empathetic tone. Make sure to avoid an overly familiar or sales approach and do not use the phrases "hope you are well," "just checking in," or "please."
