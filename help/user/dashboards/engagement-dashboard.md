# Engagement dashboard



## Engagement Overview

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of engagement and showcases real-time metrics of account and individual interactions through snapshot donut charts and trend-revealing line charts over time. It helps you monitor and strategize your engagement efforts effectively.

### Engagement by Accounts / People

The donut charts clearly divide accounts or people into engaged and non-engaged categories. The central figure denotes the total count within each category, providing an at-a-glance understanding of overall engagement.

### Engagement by Accounts / People Over Time

These line charts display the engagement levels of accounts or people over time. With distinct lines for 'Engaged' and 'Not Engaged,' visualized alongside a time-stamped horizontal axis, you can pinpoint trends and patterns. You can hover over a line to reveal precise metrics for any given date.
