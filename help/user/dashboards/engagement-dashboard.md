## Engagement by accounts / buying group / people 

The circle charts divide accounts, buying groups, or people into engaged and non-engaged categories. The central figure displays the total count within each category, providing an at-a-glance understanding of overall engagement.

These line charts display the engagement levels of accounts or people over time. With distinct lines for 'Engaged' and 'Not Engaged,' visualized alongside a time-stamped horizontal axis, you can pinpoint trends and patterns. You can hover over a line to reveal precise metrics for any given date.
