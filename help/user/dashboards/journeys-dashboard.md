# Journey Overview dashboard

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of engagement and showcases real-time metrics of account and individual interactions through snapshot donut charts and trend-revealing line charts over time. It helps you monitor and strategize your engagement efforts effectively.

## Journey Status

This donut chart offers a breakdown of journey statuses, categorizing accounts into `Completed`, `In Progress`, and `Aborted`. Each segment is clearly labeled with corresponding percentages and account numbers on the outer edge of the chart.

## Journey Completion Over Time

This line chart tracks the number of accounts that have completed their journey over time. The horizontal axis maps the timeline while the vertical axis quantifies the accounts, providing a straightforward view of completion trends.

* **[!UICONTROL Journey Completion Rate]** - The percentage of accounts that have successfully completed their journey.
* **[!UICONTROL Journey Duration]** - The average length of time taken for accounts to complete their journey.
