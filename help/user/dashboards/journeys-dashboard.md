# Journey Overview dashboard

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of a selected account journey, detailing account progress using donut and line charts that categorize and quantify completions, in-progress activities, and aborts over time. It helps marketers evaluate the effectiveness of Email and SMS channels through key delivery and engagement metrics.

This overview is available for published account journeys, and it takes approximately four hours for data to start populating the charts and tables.

## Journey status

This donut chart offers a breakdown of journey statuses, categorizing accounts into `Completed`, `In Progress`, and `Aborted`. Each segment is clearly labeled with corresponding percentages and account numbers on the outer edge of the chart.

## Journey completion over time

This line chart tracks the number of accounts that have completed their journey over time. The horizontal axis maps the timeline while the vertical axis quantifies the accounts, providing a straightforward view of completion trends.
