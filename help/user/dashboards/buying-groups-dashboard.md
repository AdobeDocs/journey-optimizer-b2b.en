# Buying Groups Overview dashboard

The Buying Group Overview dashboard is designed for the B2B Sales Handoff process. It enables the Marketing team to share _ready_ buying groups and their members along with essential data to the Sales team for execution. This process ensures a streamlined transition from marketing to sales.

The Sales Handoff comprises:

* **Data Handoff**: Marketing identifies _ready_ target data and makes it accessible to Sales in the CSV format. 
* **Sales Acceptance**: Sales manually reviews and incorporates _ready_ targets into their pipeline.

## Buying Group Status

Gain insights into your buying groups' progression with the Buying Group Status view. This visualization showcases the distribution of your buying groups categorized by their most recent status update within a specified time frame.
