# Buying Groups Overview dashboard

The Overview dashboard for buying groups is designed for the B2B Sales handoff process. It enables the Marketing team to share _ready_ buying groups and their members along with essential data to the Sales team for execution. This process ensures a streamlined transition from marketing to sales.

The Sales handoff comprises:

* **Data handoff**: Marketing identifies _ready_ target data and makes it accessible to Sales in the CSV format.Â 
* **Sales acceptance**: Sales manually reviews and incorporates _ready_ targets into their pipeline.

To access this dashboard, expand **[!UICONTROL Accounts]** in the left navigation and then select **[!UICONTROL Buying groups]**. Select the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** tab if it is not displayed by default.
