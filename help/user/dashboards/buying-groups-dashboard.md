# Buying Groups Overview dashboard

The Buying Group Overview dashboard is designed for the B2B Sales Handoff process. It enables the Marketing team to share _ready_ buying groups and their members along with essential data to the Sales team for execution. This process ensures a streamlined transition from marketing to sales.

The Sales Handoff comprises:

* **Data Handoff**: Marketing identifies _ready_ target data and makes it accessible to Sales in the CSV format. 
* **Sales Acceptance**: Sales manually reviews and incorporates _ready_ targets into their pipeline.
